# What is React

ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) or UI components. It's maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a large community of individual developers and companies

# What are the features of React?

- ### **Component-Based Architecture**
- ### **Virtual DOM**
- ### **JSX (JavaScript XML)**
- ### **Declarative Programming**
- ### Unidirectional Data Flow

# **What is JSX?**

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like structures directly within your JavaScript code.


# What is Props

Think of them as arguments you pass to a function, but in the context of React components, they are read-only values that allow parent components to control and configure their children.

# What is state in React?

In React, state is a mechanism that allows components to manage and update their own internal data over time. Unlike props, which are passed down from parent components and are read-only from the child's perspective, state is managed within a component and can be changed in response to user interactions, network requests, or other events. When a component's state changes, React re-renders the component and its children, updating the UI to reflect the new data
