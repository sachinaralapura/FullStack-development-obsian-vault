Redux is a state management library that allows you to manage the state of your JavaScript applications more efficiently and predictably.
Imagine you are building a house and need to keep track of all the materials you use and how much money you spend. Instead of keeping track of everything in your head or on a piece of paper, you could use a ledger to keep track of every transaction. Redux works similarly by keeping track of your application's state in a single place called the "store."
## Why Should I Use Redux?

Redux can help simplify the state management process, especially when dealing with complex and interconnected components. Here are some reasons why you might want to use Redux in your application:

1. **Centralized state management:** With Redux, you can maintain the state of your entire application in a single store, making it easier to manage and access data across components.
2. **Predictable state updates:** Redux has a clear flow of data, which means changes to the state can only happen when you create an action and send it through Redux. This makes it easy to understand how your application's data will change in response to user actions.
3. **Easier debugging:** With Redux DevTools, you have a clear record of all the changes to your application's state. This makes locating and fixing issues in your code easier, saving you time and effort in the debugging process.
4. **Better performance:** By minimizing the number of state updates and reducing the need for prop drilling, Redux helps improve your application's performance.
