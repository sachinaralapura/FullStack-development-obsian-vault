## Databases

 This is the top-level container for your data. In relational databases, a database serves a similar purpose â€“ it's a logical grouping of related tables.

## Collections

A collection is a group of MongoDB documents. Conceptually, this is similar to a **table** in a relational database. However, unlike tables that enforce a fixed schema, collections in MongoDB are **schema-less**.his means that the documents within a single collection can have different structures.

## Documents

A document is the basic unit of data in MongoDB. It's a set of key-value pairs, similar to a **row** in a relational database.
