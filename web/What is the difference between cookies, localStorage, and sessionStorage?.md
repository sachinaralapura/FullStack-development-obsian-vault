The key differences between cookies, localStorage, and sessionStorage are:

**1. Data Persistence:**

- **Cookies:** Can be persistent or session-based.1 Persistent cookies remain on the user's device until their expiration date, while session cookies are deleted when the browser window or tab is closed.
    
- **localStorage:** Data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.2 It remains available until explicitly cleared by the user or through JavaScript code.34
    
- **sessionStorage:** Data is stored only for the duration of the current page session. Once the browser tab or window is closed, the data is cleared.

**2. Storage Limit:**

- **Cookies:** Have a small storage limit, typically around 4KB per cookie.5
    
- **localStorage:** Offers a significantly larger storage limit, generally around 5MB to 10MB per origin (depending on the browser).6
    
- **sessionStorage:** Similar to localStorage, with a storage limit of around 5MB per origin.7
    

**3. Scope and Accessibility:**

- **Cookies:** Are domain-specific and are sent with every HTTP request to the server for that domain.8 They can also be made accessible to the server-side.
    
- **localStorage:** Data is accessible from any window or tab of the same origin (domain, protocol, and port).9 It is only accessible on the client-side.10
    
- **sessionStorage:** Data is accessible only within the same tab or window that created it.11 Each tab or window has its own separate sessionStorage.12 It is also only accessible on the client-side.
    

**4. Network Traffic:**

- **Cookies:** Are automatically sent to the server with every HTTP request for the corresponding domain, which can increase network traffic.13
    
- **localStorage & sessionStorage:** Data is stored on the client-side and is not automatically sent to the server with each request, thus reducing network traffic.14 Data can be sent to the server manually if needed.
    

**5. Use Cases:**

- **Cookies:** Primarily used for managing user sessions, authentication, tracking user behavior, and storing small amounts of data like user preferences that might need to be accessed by the server.15
    
- **localStorage:** Suitable for storing non-sensitive data that needs to persist across sessions, such as user preferences (themes, settings), offline data, or caching data for performance.16
    
- **sessionStorage:** Ideal for storing temporary, session-specific data, such as user input in multi-step forms, the state of a single page, or temporary authentication tokens.17
